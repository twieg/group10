# WEB Part C, Rate Your Lecture - RYL
*Group 10 - Amir Olizkey, Shay Twieg*

## Project Overview
This web application, "Rate Your Lecturer - RYL," is designed for college and university students to provide a comprehensive platform for rating and giving feedback on lecturers. The app aims to fulfill students' desire for objective information on lecturers and courses, allowing them to easily share their experiences, give ratings, and leave comments. Lecturers can view their ratings and access statistical information on feedback, fostering a supportive and knowledge-sharing community. Each lecturer will have a profile page with personal details, including name, photo (if approved), teaching institutions, subjects taught, degrees, years of experience, interests, overall rating, and student comments. Additionally, each course will have its own page with a brief description and a display of all lecturers teaching the course by institution.
